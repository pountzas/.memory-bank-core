intent: Leverage Claude AI skill for travel-planner to enhance development workflow and deliver specialized expertise
input_format: task_description, context_details, skill_parameters
output_format: Claude skill execution results, generated assets, implementation guidance
steps: |
  0. Verify current branch location and create feature branch if necessary: git branch --show-current, create feature/claude-travel-planner if on dev (MANDATORY - before any work)
  1. Verify workspace location (MANDATORY): Set-Location -Path "."; (Get-Location).Path
  2. Review available Claude skill capabilities and resources
  3. Prepare task context and parameters for skill invocation
  4. Execute Claude skill with appropriate inputs
  5. Review and validate skill-generated outputs
  6. Integrate skill results into project workflow
  7. RIGHT BEFORE git add: Test skill outputs and verify implementation
  8. Document skill usage and results for future reference
acceptance_criteria: |
  - Claude skill successfully executed with provided inputs
  - Skill outputs meet quality and relevance standards
  - Generated assets properly integrated into project
  - Documentation updated with skill usage details
  - No conflicts with existing codebase patterns
timebox_minutes: 60
dependencies: []
version: 1.0.0
notes: This template leverages the specialized Claude AI skill "travel-planner" for enhanced development capabilities. Ensure skill prerequisites are met before execution. CRITICAL - Create feature branch BEFORE any work begins. Never commit directly to dev. Always verify workspace directory location. ALWAYS use PowerShell for terminal commands. RIGHT BEFORE git add: Test skill outputs thoroughly.
